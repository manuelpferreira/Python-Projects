# Python-Projects
Here you can find some of my Python Projects that I'm building in order to upgrade my Python and programming skills.

Some of them are short programmes that I just developed to try some new stuff, so don't be surprised if they are not really functional or pretty.

If you have some suggestions you can always send me some text. And if you want, feel free to download and play with my code. :)
